Major changes include:

- Migrating the new document build pipeline from MASVS to MSTG. This allows us to build consistently the whole OWASP MSTG documents (PDF, docx etc.) in minutes, without any manual work.

Besides numerous changes for the test cases we have a new Crackme - Android Level 4 <https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/tree/master/Crackmes/Android/Level_04>
and also new write-ups for the Crackmes.

We removed all references to Needle and IDB tool, as both tools are outdated.

Several other minor updates include fixing typos and markdown lint errors and updating outdated links.

We thank you all contributors for the hard work and continuously improving the document and the OWASP MSTG project!
