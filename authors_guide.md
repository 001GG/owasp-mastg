Author's guide

This document contains guidelines for new authors joining the OWASP MSTG. Please read them carefully.

## Roles

Different roles are available for MSTG participants. In principle you can pick any role you want, but note that with great power comes great reponsiblity:
Once you have taken over a role, you'll be expected to deliver certain results.

### Lead author

The lead author takes overall ownership of a chapter or group of test cases (such as "Data Storage on Android"). A lead author should:

1. Contribute an significant amount of quality content to the chapter(s) owned;
2. Coordinate the work of authors and reviews working on subchapters;
3. Manage pull requests for this chapter and ensure the quality of contributions;
4. Moderate discussions about issues in the chapter(s) owned;
5. Ensure that milestones for chapter are reached on time.

The lead author should be highly responsive and actively engage in discussions on GitHub and Slack. This requires significant effort, so you should only take up this role if you're sure you can put in the time. 

### Contributor

Contributors write content such as single test cases or parts of test cases. For example, a contributor could submit a how-to for testing the custom URL schemes exported by an app. Contributors should:

1. Deliver quality content on the selected topic;
2. Actively engage with the chapter owners and reviewers via GitHub and Slack.

### Reviewer

Reviewers are subject matter experts that help ensure the quality of the MSTG. A reviewer will usually pick several chapters and test case groups, and are called upon whenever new content has been added to the selected sections of the MSTG. The reviewer should:

1. Ensure technical accuracy of the content reviewed;
2. Check for grammar and spelling errors;
3. Provide feedback and actively engage with the chapter owners and reviewers via GitHub and Slack.

In our experience, opinions will differ in many cases. Whenever differences cannot easily be resolved, open an issue on GitHub and bring it up for discussion. Usually, the open discussion will result in a resolution - if not, the lead author of the chapter in question has the last word.
