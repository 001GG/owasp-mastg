# Author's guide

This document contains guidelines for new authors joining the OWASP MSTG. Please read them carefully.

## Picking a Role

Different roles are available for MSTG participants. In principle all roles are available to anyone, but note that with great power comes great reponsiblity. Once you have taken over a role, you'll be expected to deliver certain results.

### Lead author

The lead author takes overall ownership of a chapter or group of test cases (such as "Data Storage on Android"). A lead author should:

1. Contribute an significant amount of quality content to the chapter(s) owned;
2. Coordinate the work of authors and reviews working on subchapters;
3. Manage pull requests for this chapter and ensure the quality of contributions;
4. Moderate discussions about issues in the chapter(s) owned;
5. Ensure that milestones for chapter are reached on time.

The lead author is expected to be highly responsive and actively engage in discussions on GitHub and Slack. This requires significant effort, so you should only take up this role if you're sure you can put in the time. 

### Contributor

Contributors write content such as single test cases or parts of test cases. For example, a contributor could submit a how-to for testing the custom URL schemes exported by an app. Contributors should:

1. Deliver quality content on the selected topic;
2. Actively engage with the chapter owners and reviewers via GitHub and Slack.

### Reviewer

Reviewers are subject matter experts that help ensure the quality of the MSTG. A reviewer will usually pick several chapters and test case groups, and are called upon whenever new content has been added to the selected sections of the MSTG. The reviewer should:

1. Ensure technical accuracy of the content reviewed;
2. Check for grammar and spelling errors;
3. Provide feedback and actively engage with the chapter owners and reviewers via GitHub and Slack.

In our experience, opinions will differ in many cases. Whenever differences cannot easily be resolved, open an issue on GitHub and bring it up for discussion. Usually, the open discussion will result in a resolution - if not, the lead author of the chapter in question has the last word.

## How to become an author

To become a contributor or reviewer, contact the lead author of the respective chapter. 

## Attribution and Acknowledgement

Lead authors, contributors and reviewer are listed in the acknowledgements section of the guide.

### Using Content from OWASP MSTG Beta 2

Originally, the OWASP MSTG was developed on Google docs. Lead authors starting on a chapter should check this document first and transfer any usable content into the new version of the guide. Whenever content from the Google Doc is used, the original authors must be credited. Unfortunately, this process can sometimes be painful, but there's no way around it (missing attribution one of the main reason we moved to GitHub). To determine the original authors try the following:

1. Check the owner, authors and reviewers column in the [project plan](http://goo.gl/SsXAvC) (now obsolete);
2. Check the revision history of the Google doc;
3. If you still can't figure it out, ask on the [Slack channel] or on the [mailing list];
4. If the original author(s) aren't aware of the new MSTG, invite them to join.
5. Add the content to the new MSTG.
6. Add the original author(s) to the acknowledgemens and make a note in the attribution document.
