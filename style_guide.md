# Style Guide

The following rules are meant to ensure consistency of the MSTG:

1. Keep the content factual, brief and focused. Avoid duplicating other sections of the guide;
2. Refrain from advertising commercial tools or services;
3. When giving technical instructions, address the reader in the second person.

## Title Capitalization

We follow the title case rules from the "Chicago Manual of Style":  

- Capitalize the first and last word in a title, regardless of part of speech
- Capitalize all nouns (baby, country, picture), pronouns (you, she, it), verbs (walk, think, dream), adjectives (sweet, large, perfect), adverbs (immediately, quietly), and subordinating conjunctions (as, because, although)
- Lowercase “to” as part of an infinitive
- Lowercase all articles (a, the), prepositions (to, at, in, with), and coordinating conjunctions (and, but, or)

When in doubt, you can verify proper capitalization on [www.titlecapitalization.com](http://www.titlecapitalization.com/).
