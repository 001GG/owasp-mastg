## Basic Security Testing on iOS

### Setting Up Your Testing Environment

#### Jailbreaking iOS

In the iOS world, jailbreaking means disabling Apple's code code signing mechanisms so that apps not signed by Apple can be run. If you're planning to do any form of dynamic security testing on an iOS device, you'll have a much easier time on a jailbroken device, as most useful testing tools are only available outside the app store.

Developing a jailbreak for any given version of iOS is not an easy endeavor. As a security tester, you'll most likely want to use publicly available jailbreak tools (don't worry, we're all script kiddies in some areas). Even so, we recommend studying the techniques used to jailbreak various versions of iOS in the past - you'll encounter many highly interesting exploits and learn a lot about the internals of the OS. For example, Pangu9 for iOS 9.x exploited at least five vulnerabilities, including a use-after-free bug in the kernel (CVE-2015-6794) and an arbitrary file system access vulnerabilty in the Photos app (CVE-2015-7037).

In jailbreak lingo, we talk about tethered and untethered jailbreaking methods. In the "tethered" scenario, the jailbreak doesn't persist throughout reboots, so the device must be connected (tethered) to a computer during every reboot to re-apply it. "Untethered" jailbreaks need only be applied once, making them the most popular choice for end users.

##### Recovering an IPA File From an Installed App

###### From Jailbroken devices

You can use Saurik's IPA Installer to recover IPAs from apps installed on the device. To do this, install IPA installer console [1] via Cydia. Then, ssh into the device and look up the bundle id of the target app. For example:

~~~
iPhone:~ root# ipainstaller -l
com.apple.Pages
com.example.targetapp
com.google.ios.youtube
com.spotify.client
~~~

Generate the IPA file for using the following command:

~~~
iPhone:~ root# ipainstaller -b com.example.targetapp -o /tmp/example.ipa
~~~

###### From non-Jailbroken devices

If the app is available on itunes, you are able to recover the ipa on MacOS with the following simple steps:

- Download the app in itunes
- Go to your itunes Apps Library
- Right-click on the app and select show in finder

#### Dumping Decrypted Executables

On top of code signing, apps distributed via the app store are also protected using Apple's FairPlay DRM system. This system uses asymmetric cryptography to ensure that any app (including free apps) obtained from the app store only executes on the particular device it is approved to run on. The decryption key is unique to the device and burned into the processor. As of now, the only possible way to obtain the decrypted code from a FairPlay-decrypted app is dumping it from memory while the app is running. On a jailbroken device, this can be done with Stefan Esser's dumpdecrypted tool [2].

Download and compile dumpdecrypted as follows (requires XCode command line tools):

~~~
$ git clone https://github.com/stefanesser/dumpdecrypted
$ cd dumpdecrypted
$ make
~~~

This should create dumpdecrypted.dylib. Copy it to the /usr/lib directory on your device via SSH:

~~~
$ scp dumpdecrypted.dylib root@iphone:/usr/lib/
~~~

Then, connect to the device and run the main executable of the target app while setting the DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES environment variable.

~~~
$ ssh root@iphone
iPhone:~ root# cd /usr/lib
iPhone:/usr/lib root#
iPhone:/usr/lib root# DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES=dumpdecrypted.dylib "/var/mobile/Containers/Bundle/Application/AAAAAAAA-BBBB-CCCC-DDDD-EEEEEEEEEE/Target.app/Target"
~~~

The decrypted binary is saved in the current working directory.

### Dynamic Analysis

#### On Jailbroken devices

#### On Non-Jailbroken Devices

If you don't have access to a jailbroken device, you can patch and repackage the target app to load a dynamic library at startup. This way, you can instrument the app and can do pretty much everything you need for a dynamical analysis (of course, you can't break out of the sandbox that way, but you usually don't need to). This technique however works only on if the app binary isn't FairPlay-encrypted (i.e. obtained from the app store).

Thanks to Apple's confusing provisioning and code signing system, re-singing an app is more challenging t than one would expect. iOS will refuse to run an app unless you get the provisioning profile and code signature header absolutely right. This requires you to learn about a whole lot of concepts - different types of certificates, BundleIDs, application IDs, team identifiers, and how they are tied together using Apple's build tools. Suffice it to say, getting the OS to run a particular binary that hasn't been built using the default way (XCode) can be an daunting process.

The toolset we're going to use consists of optool, Apple's build tools and some shell commands. Our method is inspired by the resign script from Vincent Tan's Swizzler project [4]. An alternative way of repackaging using different tools was described by NCC group [5].

To reproduce the steps listed below, download "UnCrackable iOS App Level 1" from the OWASP Mobile Testing Guide repo [6]. Our goal is to make the UnCrackable app load FridaGadget.dylib during startup so we can instrument it using Frida. 

##### Getting a Developer Provisioning Profile and Certificate

The *provisioning profile* is a plist file signed by Apple that whitelists your code signing certificate on one or multiple devices. In other words, this is Apple explicitly allowing your app to run in certain contexts, such as debugging on selected devices (development profile). The provisioning profile also includes the *entitlements* granted to your app. The *certificate* contains the private key you'll use to do the actual signing.

Depending on whether you're registered as an iOS developer, you can use one of the following two ways to obtain a certificate and provisioning profile.

**With an iOS developer account:**

If you have developed and deployed apps iOS using Xcode before, you'll already have your own code signing certificate installed. Use the *security* tool to list your existing signing identities:

~~~
$ security find-identity -p codesigning -v
  1) 61FA3547E0AF42A11E233F6A2B255E6B6AF262CE "iPhone Distribution: Vantage Point Security Pte. Ltd."
  2) 8004380F331DCA22CC1B47FB1A805890AE41C938 "iPhone Developer: Bernhard MÃ¼ller (RV852WND79)"
~~~

Log into the Apple Developer portal to issue a new App ID, then issue and download the profile [8]. The App ID can be anything - you can use the same App ID for re-signing multiple apps. Make sure you create a *development* profile and not a *distribution* profile, as you'll want to be able to debug the app.

In the examples below I'm using my own signing identity which is associated with my company's development team. I created the app-id "sg.vp.repackaged", as well as a provisioning profile aptly named "AwesomeRepackaging" for this purpose, and ended up with the file AwesomeRepackaging.mobileprovision - exchange this with your own filename in the shell commands below.

**With a regular iTunes account:**

Mercifully, Apple will issue a free development provisioning profile even if you're not a paying developer. You can obtain the profile with Xcode using your regular Apple account - simply build an empty iOS project and extract embedded.mobileprovision from the app container. The NCC blog explains this process in great detail [5].

Once you have obtained the provisioning profile, you can check its contents with the *security* tool. Besides the allowed certificates and devices, you'll find the entitlements granted to the app in the profile. You'll need those later for code signing, so extract them to a separate plist file as shown below. It is also worth having a look at the contents of the file to check if everything looks as expected.

~~~
$ security cms -D -i AwesomeRepackaging.mobileprovision > profile.plist
$ /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -x -c 'Print :Entitlements' profile.plist > entitlements.plist
$ cat entitlements.plist
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
	<key>application-identifier</key>
	<string>LRUD9L355Y.sg.vantagepoint.repackage</string>
	<key>com.apple.developer.team-identifier</key>
	<string>LRUD9L355Y</string>
	<key>get-task-allow</key>
	<true/>
	<key>keychain-access-groups</key>
	<array>
		<string>LRUD9L355Y.*</string>
	</array>
</dict>
</plist>
~~~

Note the application identitifier, which is a combination of the Team ID (LRUD9L355Y) and Bundle ID (sg.vantagepoint.repackage). This provisioning profile is only valid for the one app with this particular app id. The "get-task-allow" key is also important - when set to "true", other processes, such as the debugging server, are allowed to attach to the app (consequently, this would be set to "false" in a distribution profile).

##### Other Preparations

To make our app load an additional library at startup we need some way of inserting an additional load command into the Mach-O header of the main executable. Optool [3] can be used to automate this process:

~~~
$ git clone https://github.com/alexzielenski/optool.git
$ cd optool/
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
~~~

We'll also use ios-deploy [10], a tools that enables deploying and debugging of iOS apps without using Xcode:

~~~
git clone https://github.com/alexzielenski/optool.git
cd optool/
git submodule update --init --recursive
~~~

To follow the examples below, you also need FridaGadget.dylib:

~~~
$ curl -O https://build.frida.re/frida/ios/lib/FridaGadget.dylib
~~~

Besides the tools listed above, we'll be using standard tools that come with OS X and Xcode (make sure you have the Xcode command line developer tools installed).

##### Patching, Repackaging and Re-Signing

Time to get serious! As you already now, IPA files are actually ZIP archives, so use any zip tool to unpack the archive. Then, copy FridaGadget.dylib into the app directory, and add a load command to the "UnCrackable Level 1" binary using optool.

~~~
$ unzip UnCrackable_Level1.ipa
$ cp FridaGadget.dylib Payload/UnCrackable\ Level\ 1.app/
$ optool install -c load -p "@executable_path/FridaGadget.dylib" -t Payload/UnCrackable\ Level\ 1.app/UnCrackable\ Level\ 1
Found FAT Header
Found thin header...
Found thin header...
Inserting a LC_LOAD_DYLIB command for architecture: arm
Successfully inserted a LC_LOAD_DYLIB command for arm
Inserting a LC_LOAD_DYLIB command for architecture: arm64
Successfully inserted a LC_LOAD_DYLIB command for arm64
Writing executable to Payload/UnCrackable Level 1.app/UnCrackable Level 1...
~~~

Such blatant tampering of course invalidates the the code signature of the main executable, so this won't run on a non-jailbroken device. You'll need to replace the provisioning profile and sign both the main executable and FridaGadget.dylib with the certificate listed in the profile.

First, let's add our own provisioning profile to the package:

~~~
$ cp AwesomeRepackaging.mobileprovision Payload/UnCrackable\ Level\ 1.app/embedded.mobileprovision
~~~

Next, we need to make sure that the BundleID in Info.plist matches the one specified in the profile. The reason for this is that the "codesign" tool will read the Bundle ID from Info.plist during signing - a wrong value will lead to an invalid signature.

~~~
$ /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c "Set :CFBundleIdentifier sg.vantagepoint.repackage" Payload/UnCrackable\ Level\ 1.app/Info.plist
~~~

Finally, we use the codesign tool to re-sign both binaries:

~~~
$ rm -rf Payload/F/_CodeSignature
$ /usr/bin/codesign --force --sign 8004380F331DCA22CC1B47FB1A805890AE41C938  Payload/UnCrackable\ Level\ 1.app/FridaGadget.dylib
Payload/UnCrackable Level 1.app/FridaGadget.dylib: replacing existing signature
$ /usr/bin/codesign --force --sign 8004380F331DCA22CC1B47FB1A805890AE41C938 --entitlements entitlements.plist Payload/UnCrackable\ Level\ 1.app/UnCrackable\ Level\ 1
Payload/UnCrackable Level 1.app/UnCrackable Level 1: replacing existing signature
~~~

##### Installing and Running the App

Now you should be all set for running the modified app. Deploy and run the app on the device as follows.

~~~
$ ios-deploy --debug --bundle Payload/UnCrackable\ Level\ 1.app/
~~~

If everything went well, the app should launch on the device in debugging mode with lldb attached. Frida should now be able to attach to the app as well. You can verify this with the frida-ps command:
 
~~~
$ frida-ps -U
PID  Name
---  ------
499  Gadget
~~~

##### Troubleshooting.

If something goes wrong (which it usually does), mismatches between the provisioning profile and code signing header are the most likely suspect. In that case it is helpful to read the official documentation and gaining an understanding of how the whole system works [7][8]. I also found Apple's entitlement troubleshooting page [9] to be a useful resource.
