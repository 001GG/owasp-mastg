# Appendix

## Security Testing in the Software Development Lifecycle

### Agile and DevOps

Cross Functional teams, deployment frequencies, etc
Why are they changing the paradigm.

### Approach

Start by doing risk assessment
-> Define data classification (What is considered sensitive data in your org)
-> Set the according ASVS level
-> Integrate requirements into ALM
-> Threat model for design
-> Provide secure coding guidelines to the devs
-> Provide test cases for qa folks
-> Automate as many security tests as possible in the deployment pipeline
-> Perform exploratory security testing
-> Close feedback loop to dev team

### General Considerations

* Release time for apple store
* Why are black listed, and how to avoid it.
* Common gotchas: Ensure that the app is always fully removed and re-installed. Otherwise there might be issues that are hard to re-produce.

### SDLC Overview

-- TODO : 

- SDLC complements classical software development lifecycles and can be integrated in all of them
- SDLC diagram and description
- Quick description of all phases

--

### Secure Software Testing
-- TODO : 

- Explain how it relates to and differs from Quality testing
- Explain the different types of tests (unit, Verification, Validation, ....)

--
### Technical Management
#### Test Strategy
-- TODO : Describe what a Security Test Strategy is, how it relates to other artefacts (Threat Model, Requirements, ...), how it is declined into Test Plans and Test Cases --
#### Test Case
-- TODO : Describe a typical test case for Security --
#### Reporting and Issue tracking
-- TODO : Explain reporting and Issue tracking (principles and popular tools) --
### Testing methods
#### White box
#### Grey box
#### Black box
### Team management
-- TODO : 

- explain the importance of Separation of Duties (developers VS testers, ...)
- internal VS sub-contracted pentests
