### Testing Jailbreak Detection

#### Overview

iOS implements containerization so that each app is restricted to its own sandbox. A regular app cannot access files outside its dedicated data directories, and access to system APIs is restricted via app privileges. As a result, an app’s sensitive data as well as the integrity of the OS is guaranteed under normal conditions. However, when an adversary gains root access to the mobile operating system, the default protections can be bypassed completely.

The risk of malicious code running as root is higher on jailbroken devices, as many of the default integrity checks are disabled. Developers of apps that handle highly sensitive data should therefore consider implementing checks that either prevent the app from running under these conditions, or at least warn the user about the increased risks.
