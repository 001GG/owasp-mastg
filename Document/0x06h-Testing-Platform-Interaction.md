### Testing Jailbreak Detection

#### Overview

iOS implements containerization so that each app is restricted to its own sandbox. A regular app cannot access files outside its dedicated data directories, and access to system APIs is restricted via app privileges. As a result, an app’s sensitive data as well as the integrity of the OS is guaranteed under normal conditions. However, when an adversary gains root access to the mobile operating system, the default protections can be bypassed completely.

The risk of malicious code running as root is higher on jailbroken devices, as many of the default integrity checks are disabled. Developers of apps that handle highly sensitive data should therefore consider implementing checks that either prevent the app from running under these conditions, or at least warn the user about the increased risks.

#### Static Analysis



##### With Source Code

Look for a function with a name like isJailBroken in the code. If none of these are available, look for code checking for the following:
1. Existence of files (such as anything with cydia or substrate in the name (such as `/private/var/lib/cydia or /Library/MobileSubstrate/MobileSubstrate.dylib`), `/var/lib/apt, /bin/bash, /usr/sbin/sshd, sftp`, etc). In swift this is done with the `FileManager.default.fileExists(atPath: filePath)` function and objective-c uses `[NSFileManager defaultManager] fileExistsAtPath:filePath`, so grepping for fileExists should show you a good list.
2. Changes of directory permissions (ie being able to write to a file outside the the apps own directory - common examples are `/, /private, /lib, /etc, /System, /bin, /sbin, /cores, /etc`). /private and / seem to be the most commonly used for testing.
	2.1 Check actual permissions themselves: Swift uses `NSFilePosixPermissions` and objective-c uses `directoryAttributes`, so grep for these. 
	2.2 Check if you can write a file: Swift and objective-c both use the key words `write` and `create` for file and directory writing and creation. So grep for this and pipe to a grep for `/private` (or others) to get a reference.
3. Checking size of `/etc/fstab` - a lot of tools modify this file, but this method is uncommon as an update from apple may break this check.
4. Creation of symlinks due to the jailbreak taking up space on the system partition. Look for references to `/Library/Ringtones,/Library/Wallpaper,/usr/arm-apple-darwin9,/usr/include,/usr/libexec,/usr/share,/Applications` in the code.

##### Without Source Code

Use Cycript<sup>[3]</sup> to examine the methods for any obvious anti-Jailbreaky type name (eg `isJailBroken`). Note this requires a jailbroken iOS device with cycript installed and shell access (via ssh). Also, at time of writing, Cycript cannot manipulate native switft code (but can still look at any objective-c libraries that are called). To tell if the app is written in swift, then used the nm<sub>[4]</sub> tool:
```
nm <appname> | grep swift
```
For an Objective-C only app there will be no output. However, it is still possible the app is mixed swift and objective-c.

```
cycript -p <AppName>
cy#[ObjectiveC.classes allKeys]
```
It is recommended you pipe this to a file, then search for something that sounds like a promising classname(jailbreak, startup, system, initial, load, etc). Once you have a candidate, then list the methods:
```
cy#printMethods(<classname>)
```
Again, you may want to pipe to a file and go through it for a promising sounding method (eg has jail or root in the title).

#### Dynamic Analysis

Try running on a jailbroken device and see what happens.

#### Remediation

For iOS jailbreaking, it is worth noting that a determined hacker (or tester!) could use Cycript's method swizzling to modify this function to always return true. Of course there are more complex implementations, but nearly all can be subverted - the idea is just to make it harder. As such the following is recommended:
1. Use more than 1 of the above methods to check if a device is jailbroken.
2. Call the class and method something that is not immediately obvious (but it well commented).
3. Use swift instead of objective-c.
