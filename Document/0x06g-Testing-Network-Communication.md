### Testing for Unencrypted Sensitive Data on the Network

#### Overview

[Provide a general description of the issue.]

#### Static Analysis

[Describe how to assess this given either the source code or installer package (APK/IPA/etc.), but without running the app. Tailor this to the general situation (e.g., in some situations, having the decompiled classes is just as good as having the original source, in others it might make a bigger difference). If required, include a subsection about how to test with or without the original sources.]

[Use the &lt;sup&gt; tag to reference external sources, e.g. Meyer's recipe for tomato soup<sup>[1]</sup>.]

##### With Source Code

##### Without Source Code

#### Dynamic Analysis

[Describe how to test for this issue by running and interacting with the app. This can include everything from simply monitoring network traffic or aspects of the app’s behavior to code injection, debugging, instrumentation, etc.]

#### Remediation

[Describe the best practices that developers should follow to prevent this issue.]

### Testing Custom Certificate Stores and SSL Pinning

#### Overview

Certificate pinning allows to hard-code in the client the certificate that is known to be used by the server. This technique is used to reduce the threat of a rogue CA and CA compromise. Pinning the server’s certificate take the CA out of games. Mobile applications that implements certificate pinning only have to connect to a limited numbers of server, so a small list of trusted CA can be hard-coded in the application.

#### White-box Testing

The code presented below shows how it is possible to check if the certificate provided by the server reflects the certificate hard-coded  in the application. The method below implements the connection authentication tells the delegate that the connection will send a request for an authentication challenge.

The delegate must implement connection:canAuthenticateAgainstProtectionSpace: and connection: forAuthenticationChallenge. Within connection: forAuthenticationChallenge, the delegate must call SecTrustEvaluate to perform customary X509 checks. Below a snippet who implements a check of the certificate.  

```Objective-C
(void)connection:(NSURLConnection *)connection willSendRequestForAuthenticationChallenge:(NSURLAuthenticationChallenge *)challenge
{
SecTrustRef serverTrust = challenge.protectionSpace.serverTrust;
SecCertificateRef certificate = SecTrustGetCertificateAtIndex(serverTrust, 0);
NSData *remoteCertificateData = CFBridgingRelease(SecCertificateCopyData(certificate));
NSString *cerPath = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@"MyLocalCertificate" ofType:@"cer"];
NSData *localCertData = [NSData dataWithContentsOfFile:cerPath];
The control below can verify if the certificate received by the server is matching the one pinned in the client.
if ([remoteCertificateData isEqualToData:localCertData]) {
NSURLCredential *credential = [NSURLCredential credentialForTrust:serverTrust];
[[challenge sender] useCredential:credential forAuthenticationChallenge:challenge];
}
else {
[[challenge sender] cancelAuthenticationChallenge:challenge];
}
```

#### Black-box Testing

Dynamic analysis can be done by following the same methodology used for the Android applications.

#### Remediation

The SSL pinning process should be implemented as described on the static analysis section.
