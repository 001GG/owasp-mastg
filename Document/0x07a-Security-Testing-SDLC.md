# Security Testing in the Software Development Lifecycle

## What is Agile, what is DevOps.

Cross Functional teams, deployment frequencies, etc
Why are they changing the paradigm.

## Approach

Start by doing risk assessment
-> Define data classification (What is considered sensitive data in your org)
-> Set the according ASVS level
-> Integrate requirements into ALM
-> Threat model for design
-> Provide secure coding guidelines to the devs
-> Provide test cases for qa folks
-> Automate as many security tests as possible in the deployment pipeline
-> Perform exploratory security testing
-> Close feedback loop to dev team

## General Considerations:

* Release time for apple store
* Why are black listed, and how to avoid it.
* Common gotchas: Ensure that the app is always fully removed and re-installed. Otherwise there might be issues that are hard to re-produce.
