### Testing the Logout Functionality
#### Overview
Session termination is an important part of the session lifecycle. Reducing the lifetime of the session tokens to a minimum decreases the likelihood of a successful session hijacking attack.
 
The scope for this test case is to validate that the application has a logout functionality and it effectively terminates the session on client and server side.
 
#### Testing
To verify the correct implementation of a logout functionality, dynamic analysis should be applied by using an interception proxy. This technique can be applied to both, Android and iOS platform.  
Static Analysis
If server side code is available, it should be reviewed to validate that the session is being terminated as part of the logout functionality.
The check needed here will be different depending on the technology used. Here are different examples on how a session can be terminated in order to implement a proper logout on server side:
- Spring (Java) - http://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/current/apidocs/org/springframework/security/web/authentication/logout/SecurityContextLogoutHandler.html
-   Ruby on Rails -  http://guides.rubyonrails.org/security.html
- PHP - http://php.net/manual/en/function.session-destroy.php
-   JSF - http://jsfcentral.com/listings/A20158?link
-   ASP.Net - https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms524798(v=vs.90).aspx
-   Amazon AWS - http://docs.aws.amazon.com/appstream/latest/developerguide/rest-api-session-terminate.html

#### Dynamic Analysis
For a dynamic analysis of the application an interception proxy should be used. Please see section XXX on how to set it up.
The following steps can be applied to check if the logout is implemented properly.  
1.  Log into the application.
2.  Do a couple of operations that require authentication inside the application.
3.  Perform a logout operation.
4.  Resend one of the operations detailed in step 2 using an interception proxy. For example, with Burp Repeater. The purpose of this is to send to the server a request with the token that has been invalidated in step 3.
 
If the session is correctly terminated on the server side, either an error message or redirect to the login page will be sent back to the client. On the other hand, if you have the same response you had in step 2, then, this session is still valid and has not been correctly terminated on the server side.
A detailed explanation with more test cases, can also be found in the OWASP Web Testing Guide (OTG-SESS-006) [1].

#### Remediation 
One of the most common errors done by developers to a logout functionality is simply not destroying the session object in the server side. This leads to a state where the session is still alive even though the user logs out of the application. The session remains alive, and if an attacker get’s in possession of a valid session he can still use it and a user cannot even protect himself by logging out or if there are no session timeout controls in place.
 
To mitigate it, the logout function on the server side must invalidate this session identifier immediately after logging out to prevent it to be reused by an attacker that could have intercepted it.
 
Related to this, it must be checked that after calling an operation with an expired token, the application does not generate another valid token. This could lead to another authentication bypass.
 
Many Apps do not automatically logout a user, because of customer convenience. The user logs in once, afterwards a token is generated on server side and stored within the applications internal storage and used for authentication when the application starts instead of asking again for user credentials. There should still be a logout function available within the application and this should work according to best practices by also destroying the session on server side.

### Testing the Session Timeout
#### Overview
Compared to web applications most mobile applications don’t have a session timeout mechanism that terminates the session after some period of inactivity and force the user to login again. For most mobile applications users need to enter the credentials once. After authenticating on server side an access token is stored on the device which is used to authenticate. If the token is about to expire the token will be renewed without entering the credentials again. Applications that handle sensitive data like patient data or critical functions like financial transactions should implement a session timeout as a security-in-depth measure that forces users to re-login after a defined period.
 
We will explain here how to check that this control is implemented correctly, both in the client and server side.

#### Testing
To test this, dynamic analysis is an efficient option, as it is easy to validate if this feature is working or not at runtime using an interception proxy. This is similar to test case OMTG-AUTH-002 (Testing the Logout Functionality), but we need to leave the application in idle for the period of time required to trigger the timeout function. Once this condition has been launched, we need to validate that the session is effectively terminated on client and server side.
This technique can be applied to both, Android and iOS platform.

#### Static Analysis
If server side code is available, it should be reviewed that the session timeout functionality is correctly configured and a timeout is triggered after a defined period of time.  
The check needed here will be different depending on the technology used. Here are different examples on how a session timeout can be configured:
- Spring (Java) - http://docs.spring.io/spring-session/docs/current/reference/html5/
-   Ruby on Rails -  https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/318a20c140de57a7d5f820753c82258a3696c465/railties/lib/rails/application/configuration.rb#L130
- PHP - http://php.net/manual/en/session.configuration.php#ini.session.gc-maxlifetime
- ASP.Net - https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-GB/library/system.web.sessionstate.httpsessionstate.timeout(v=vs.110).aspx
-   Amazon AWS - http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticLoadBalancing/latest/DeveloperGuide/config-idle-timeout.html
 
Some applications also have an autologoff functionality in the client side. This is not a mandatory feature, but helps to improve to enforce a session timeout.  To implement this, the client side needs to control the timestamp when the screen has been displayed, and check continuously if the time elapsed is lower than the defined timeout. Once that time matches or excesses the timeout, the logoff method will be invoked, sending a signal to the server side to terminate the session and redirecting the customer to an informative screen.
For Android the following code might be used to implement it [3]:

public class TestActivity extends TimeoutActivity {<br>
@Override protected void onTimeout() {<br>
// logout<br>
}<br>
@Override protected long getTimeoutInSeconds() {<br>
return 15 * 60; // 15 minutes<br>
}<br>

#### Dynamic Analysis
For a dynamic analysis of the application an interception proxy should be used. Please see section XXX on how to set it up.
The following steps can be applied to check if the session timeout is implemented properly.  
-   Log into the application.
-   Do a couple of operations that require authentication inside the application.
-   Leave the application in idle until the session expires (for testing purposes, a reasonable timeout can be configured, and amended later in the final version)
 
Resend one of the operations executed in step 2 using an interception proxy. For example, with Burp Repeater. The purpose of this is to send to the server a request with the session ID that has been invalidated when the session has expired.
If session timeout has been correctly configured on the server side, either an error message or redirect to the login page will be sent back to the client. On the other hand, if you have the same response you had in step 2, then, this session is still valid, which means that the session timeout control is not configured correctly.
More information can also be found in the OWASP Web Testing Guide (OTG-SESS-007) [1].

#### Remediation
Most of the frameworks have a parameter to configure the session timeout. This parameter should be set accordingly to the best practices specified of the documentation of the framework. The best practice timeout setting may vary between 5 to 30 minutes, depending on the sensitivity of your application and the use case of it.
Regarding autologoff, the pseudocode of the implementation should be as follow:

Function autologoff<br>
    Get timestamp_start<br>
    While application_is_running<br>
        time=timestamp-timestamp_start<br>
        If time=logoff_condition<br>
            Call logoff<br>
        EndIf<br>
    EndWhile<br>
End<br>
