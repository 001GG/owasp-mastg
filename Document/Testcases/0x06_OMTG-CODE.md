### OMTG-CODE-007: Testing for Secure Compiler Flags
Compilers such as CLANG and GCC support hardening options that add additional runtime security features and checks to the generated executables. While these hardening features donâ€™t fix broken code, they do make exploitation of bugs such as buffer overflows more difficult, and should be activated as a defense-in-depth measure.
