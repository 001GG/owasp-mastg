### OMTG-RARE-001: Test the Custom Keyboard

#### Overview

[Provide a general description of the issue.]

#### Static Analysis

[Describe how to assess this given either the source code or installer package (APK/IPA/etc.), but without running the app. Tailor this to the general situation (e.g., in some situations, having the decompiled classes is just as good as having the original source, in others it might make a bigger difference). If required, include a subsection about how to test with or without the original sources.]

[Use the &lt;sup&gt; tag to reference external sources, e.g. Meyer's recipe for tomato soup<sup>[1]</sup>.]

##### With Source Code

##### Without Source Code

#### Dynamic Analysis

[Describe how to test for this issue by running and interacting with the app. This can include everything from simply monitoring network traffic or aspects of the app’s behavior to code injection, debugging, instrumentation, etc.]

### OMTG-RARE-004: Test Debugging Defenses

#### Overview

Debugging is a highly effective way of analyzing the runtime behaviour of an app. It allows the reverse engineer to step through the code, stop execution of the app at arbitrary point, inspect and modify the state of variables, and a lot more.

(...TODO...)

The app should either actively prevent debuggers from attaching, or terminate when a debugger is detected.

#### White-box Testing

(Describe how to assess this with access to the source code and build configuration)

#### Black-box Testing

(... TODO ... testing in basic form vs. advanced defenses)

Attach a debugger to the running process. This  should either fail, or the app should terminate or misbehave when the debugger has been detected. For example, if ptrace(PT_DENY_ATTACH) has been called, gdb will crash with a segmentation fault:

(TODO example)

(TODO JDWP)

Note that some anti-debugging implementations respond in a stealthy way so that changes in behaviour are not immediately apparent. For example, a soft token app might not visibly respond when a debugger is detected, but instead secretly alter the state of an internal variable so that an incorrect OTP is generated at a later point. Make sure to run through the complete workflow to determine if attaching the debugger causes a crash or malfunction.
