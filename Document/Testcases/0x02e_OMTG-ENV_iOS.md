### OMTG-ENV-001: Test of App permissions

#### Overview

[Provide a general description of the issue.]

#### Static Analysis

[Describe how to assess this given either the source code or installer package (APK/IPA/etc.), but without running the app. Tailor this to the general situation (e.g., in some situations, having the decompiled classes is just as good as having the original source, in others it might make a bigger difference). If required, include a subsection about how to test with or without the original sources.]

[Use the &lt;sup&gt; tag to reference external sources, e.g. Meyer's recipe for tomato soup<sup>[1]</sup>.]

##### With Source Code

##### Without Source Code

#### Dynamic Analysis

[Describe how to test for this issue by running and interacting with the app. This can include everything from simply monitoring network traffic or aspects of the app’s behavior to code injection, debugging, instrumentation, etc.]

#### Remediation

[Describe the best practices that developers should follow to prevent this issue.]

### OMTG-ENV-010: Test for Jailbreak detection

#### Overview

iOS implements containerization so that each app is restricted to its own sandbox. A regular app cannot access files outside its dedicated data directories, and access to system APIs is restricted via app privileges. As a result, an app’s sensitive data as well as the integrity of the OS is guaranteed under normal conditions. However, when an adversary gains root access to the mobile operating system, the default protections can be bypassed completely.

The risk of malicious code running as root is higher on jailbroken devices, as many of the default integrity checks are disabled. Developers of apps that handle highly sensitive data should therefore consider implementing checks that either prevent the app from running under these conditions, or at least warn the user about the increased risks.

If required, include a subsection about how to test with or without the original sources.]
