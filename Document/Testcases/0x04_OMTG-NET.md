### OMTG-NET-004: Testing SSL Pinning
Certificate pinning allows to hard-code in the client the certificate that is known to be used by the server. This technique is used to reduce the threat of a rogue CA and CA compromise. Pinning the serverâ€™s certificate take the CA out of games. Mobile applications that implements certificate pinning only have to connect to a limited numbers of server, so a small list of trusted CA can be hard-coded in the application.
