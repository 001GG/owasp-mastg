title: Repackaging
---

You can easily repackage an app by doing the following:

```bash
cd UnCrackable-Level1
apktool b
zipalign -v 4 dist/UnCrackable-Level1.apk ../UnCrackable-Repackaged.apk
```

Note that the Android Studio build tools directory must be in the path. It is located at `[SDK-Path]/build-tools/[version]`. The `zipalign` and `apksigner` tools are in this directory.
