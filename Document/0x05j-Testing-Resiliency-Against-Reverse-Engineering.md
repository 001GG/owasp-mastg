### Testing Advanced Root Detection

#### Overview

The goal of root detection (in the context of reverse engineering defense) is to make it a bit more difficult to run the app on a rooted device, which in turn impedes some tools and techniques reverse engineers like to use. As with most other defenses, root detection is not a very effective on its own, but having some root checks sprinkled throughout the app can improve the effectiveness of the overall anti-tampering scheme.

Effective root detection should fulfill the following criteria:

- Multiple detection methods are scattered throughout the app (as opposed to using only a single check);
- The root detection mechanisms operate on multiple API layers (Java API, native functions, system calls);
- The mechanisms have some level of originality (not just copy/paste from StackOverflow);
- The mechanisms are well-integrated with other defenses (e.g. root detection functions are obfuscated and protected from tampering).

On Android, we define the term "root detection" a bit more broadly to include detection of custom ROMs, i.e. verifying whether the device is a stock Android build or not.

##### Common Root Detection Methods

###### SafetyNet

SafetyNet is an Android API that creates a profile of the device using software and hardware information. This profile is then compared against a list of white-listed device models that have passed Android compatibility testing. In part, this is meant to asses to be used to assess the integrity and safety of the device. Google recommends using the feature as "an additional in-depth defense signal as part of an anti-abuse system" [1].

What exactly SafetyNet does under the hood is not well documented, and may change at any time: When you call this API, the service actually downloads a binary package containing the device vaidation code from Google, which is then dynamically executed using reflection. Some analysis shows that the checks performed by SafetyNet also attempt to detect whether the device is rooted, although it is unclear how extacly this is determined [2].

To use the API, an app may the SafetyNetApi.attest() method with returns a JWS message with the *Attestation Result*, and then check the following fields:

- ctsProfileMatch: Of "true", the device profile matches one of Google's listed devices that have passed  Android compatibility testing.
- basicIntegrity: The device running the app likely wasn't tampered with.

  "ctsProfileMatch": true,

}~~~

###### Self-made Checks

**File checks**

Checking for the existance of files typically found on rooted devices is a very common method. This includes app packages of common rooting tools


One could also attmept to detect binaries that are usually installed once a device is rooted. Examples include checking for the *su* binary at different locations, or attempting to execute *su* and checking the return value. Typical binaries checked for are:

~~~
/system/bin/su
/system/xbin/su
/system/xbin/busybox
~~

**Checking running processes**

ActivityManager.getRunningAppProcesses 

daemonsu


**Checking installed app packages**

The Android package manager can be used to obtain a list of installed packages. 

com.noshufou.android.su
com.chainfire.supersu

**Checking for writable partitions and system directories**

Unusual permissions on system directories can indicate a customized or rooted device.

~~~
/system
/system/bin
/system/sbin
/system/xbin
/vendor/bin
~~~

Rooting makes certain root folders readable, like /data, or writable, like /etc, /system/xbin, /system, /proc, /vendor/bin etc. Run the mount command and check if any device is mounted with “rw” flag, or try to create a file under “/system” or “/data” folder.


**Checking for custom Android builds**

** Checking the BUILD tag for test-keys **

** Checking for Over The Air (OTA) certs. On stock Android builds, OTA updates use Google's public certificates. If these certificates are missing, this indicates that a custom ROM is installed [3]. **

### Testing Debugging Defenses

#### Overview

Debugging is a highly effective way of analyzing the runtime behaviour of an app. It allows the reverse engineer to step through the code, stop execution of the app at arbitrary point, inspect and modify the state of variables, and a lot more.

(...TODO...)

The app should either actively prevent debuggers from attaching, or terminate when a debugger is detected.

#### White-box Testing

(Describe how to assess this with access to the source code and build configuration)

#### Black-box Testing

(... TODO ... testing in basic form vs. advanced defenses)

Attach a debugger to the running process. This  should either fail, or the app should terminate or misbehave when the debugger has been detected. For example, if ptrace(PT_DENY_ATTACH) has been called, gdb will crash with a segmentation fault:

(TODO example)

(TODO JDWP)

Note that some anti-debugging implementations respond in a stealthy way so that changes in behaviour are not immediately apparent. For example, a soft token app might not visibly respond when a debugger is detected, but instead secretly alter the state of an internal variable so that an incorrect OTP is generated at a later point. Make sure to run through the complete workflow to determine if attaching the debugger causes a crash or malfunction.
