# Testing Processes and Techniques

## Black-box Testing

## White-box Testing

## Static Analysis

## Dynamic Analysis

## Tampering and Reverse Engineering

## Assessing Software Protections

On the highest level we classify reverse engineering defenses into two categories: Functional defenses and obfuscations. Both are used in tandem to achieve resiliency. Table 1 gives an overview of the categories and sub-categories as they are used in the guide.
