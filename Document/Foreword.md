On a beautiful summer day, a group of ~10 young men, one woman and approximately three squirrels met in a villa. So far, nothing unusual. But little did you know, within the next five days, they'd redefine not only mobile application security testing, but the very fundamentals of bookwriting itself!

Or maybe not. But the MSTG is not a normal security book. Nor does it have a single author. It is an open, agile, crowd-sourced effort, made of the contributions of dozens of authors and reviewers from all over the world. Our wholehearted thanks go to everyone who contributed to this project. 

Mobile apps are a thing nowadays, so mobile app security is also a thing. As of this writing however, there is no widely accepted list of security best practices for mobile apps. With the OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide (MSTG), we aim to create those best practices, along with a comprehensive set of security test cases to verify them. The best practices and test cases are packaged into beginner friendly, complete and practical guide to mobile app security testing and reverse engineering.
