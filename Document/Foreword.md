The MSTG is not a normal security book. Nor does it have a single author. It is an open, crowd-sourced effort, made of the contributions of dozens of authors and reviewers from all over the world. Our wholehearted thanks go to everyone who contributed to this project. Special commendations also go to the OWASP Foundation, for being the hub bringing all of us together, as well as funding the project.
