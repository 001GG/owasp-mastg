The first rule of the OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide is: Don't just follow the OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide. Successful hacking requires a deep understanding of the object being hacked. Make sure to study and understand mobile hardware architectures, operating systems and APIs, and develop your own mobile apps. Be hacker-minded and develop your skill to identify potential security pitfalls.

With that in mind, the MSTG can be used as a comprehensive reference guide for conducting mobile application security tests.
